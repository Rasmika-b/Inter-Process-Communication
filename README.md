# Inter-Process-Communication

A process can be of two types:

- Independent process
- Co-operating process

An independent process is not affected by the execution of other processes while a cooperating process can be affected by other executing processes. Though one can think that 
those processes, which are running independently, will execute very efficiently, in reality, there are many situations when co-operative nature can be utilised for increasing 
computational speed, convenience and modularity. Inter process communication (IPC) is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their 
actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of cooperation between them. 

Processes can communicate with each other through both:

- Message Passing
- Shared Memory

Here, are the reasons for using the inter process communication protocol for information sharing:

- It helps to speedup modularity
- Computational
- Privilege separation
- Convenience
- Helps OS to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions

Thank you!!
